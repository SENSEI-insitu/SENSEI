SENSEI User Guide
=================
Version: |release|

Write once run everywhere. SENSEI provides access to a diverse set of in situ
analysis back-ends and transport layers through a simple API and data model.
Simulations instrumented with the SENSEI API can process data using any of
these back-ends interchangeably. The back-ends are selected and configured at
run-time via an XML configuration file. This document is targeted at scientists
and developers wishing to run simulations instrumented with SENSEI, instrument
a new simulation, or develop new analysis back-ends.
