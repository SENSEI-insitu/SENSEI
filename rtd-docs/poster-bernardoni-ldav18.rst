Abstract
========

Nek5000 is a massively-parallel computational fluid dynamics code, which is widely used and researched, including as part of a co-design center of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP). As computation capacity reaches exascale, storage bandwidth remains stable leading to a larger percentage of time spent performing I/O. In situ analysis overcomes this issue by processing the data before it is written to disk. One method for accomplishing in situ analysis is through SENSEI, a generic in situ interface that enables the use of many existing in situ infrastructures with little modification to the simulation. In this work, we present the instrumentation of Nek5000 with SENSEI and evaluate its ability to accelerate the development of large scale simulation campaigns.
